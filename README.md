# One-Off Note

With this service you can send messages without fear that they will be distributed along with the name of the sender. After the first visit to the page of a note, it will be completely deleted from the server. Another way to use is a contest, where the first participant to guess the password will be able to leave their name and take the prize.

You can track the status of a note by adding "/details" to its link.
